Using the marching squares and open simplex noise algorithms, draw a contour line that follows the noise algorithm. For each contour segement, draw 4 lines ranging from a length of 10, to 70 units. The widest line should appear darker, and shorter lines should appear more vibrant. All lines should use the same palette of greens.
