Using the Archimedes spiral formula, draw 8 groups of spirals. The end of each spiral is also the begining of another one. This has the effect of creating shapes that mimic, but does not logically recreate the tendrils of a vine. This is an example of a theological algorithm: one that seeks to get close to the nature of things, without acting like the thing [(Claghorn 141)](https://www.repo.uni-hannover.de/handle/123456789/3768).
