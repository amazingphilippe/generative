Using the formula for the Halton sequence, draw between 3 and 80 groups of 9 concentric rings. The rings share randomly the same colour palette. Sometimes, a filled circle can highlight a group of rings. Sometimes, a smaller filled circle can fill the inner most ring of a group of rings.

The Halton sequence can draw points that seem random in 2D space. The sequence can be broken by providing higher seed numbers. The result cause some points to be perfectly aligned. This means that by varying the seed number, we can get both ordered and disordered outputs.
