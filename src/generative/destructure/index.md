This is my entry for #genuary 5 2024, for which the prompt is "In the style of Vera Molnár (1924-2023)". I wasn't familiar with Vera's work, but I find it very inspiring. In my work, I lean heavily on vectors, lines, and simple shapes and colors. I see the same with Vera's work, and exploring her works made me realize some similarities with my work. While researching this prompt, I realized Vera's work is very much present online in the creative coding community.

I chose to remix her series _Structure de quadrilatères_, which has already been remixed a ton. So I wanted to give it a twist, by remixing it with my [Cave](/generative/cave) sketch. I think the mix of both ideas removes the structure you feel by looking a Vera's work.
