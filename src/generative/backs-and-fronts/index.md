For a given width, fill the space with rectangles until roughly all the space available is covered. Each rectangle shoud contain a vertical or horizontal striped pattern. The stripes should alternate between a more or less saturated color and a neutral colour. The output should be of a generative piece that blurs its own boudaries.
