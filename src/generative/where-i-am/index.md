Create a random <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address. Find coordinates for thatc IP address. Using feature data from [open street map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features), look for hamlets and villages near this IP address.

For each village or hamlet, draw a circle. Take 20 triple of hamlets and villages. Draw an arc that starts at one, passe through the second, and ends at the last. Along these arcs, draw between 0 and 5 triangles pointing in the same direction as the arc. Outline the middle hamlet or village with a bigger circle.

Sometimes, you can also connect a village or a hamlet to all of its neighbours with a straight line.

Sometimes, also connect a string of hamlets and villages with a dashed line.
