Start by dividing the canvas in two areas, either vertically, horizontally, or not at all. Repeat for 7 iterations.

Choose if there should be padding or not in between each area. Outline each area with a box.

For each of these areas, draw several rows of vertical lines. Your vertical lines should be spaced evenly and either all have the same length, or all different lengths. If your lines are of equal lengths, they should all be perfectly aligned.
