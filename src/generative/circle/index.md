Draw 60 segments forming a regular polygon. In other words: draw the points for a [Hexacontagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon#Naming). Additionally, draw a few random points within the bottom right of the shape. For each polygon points, draw 1000 lines of varying shades of colour between any random two points. Draw another 500 lines between any polygon point and any random point within the shape. Finally, draw 500 three point polylines between one random polygon point, one random inside point, and another random polygon point.
