Draw 2 groups of squares arranged in a 2 by 4 grid. Squares should orient their gradients towards the center of the image, just like a Fresnel lens.
This generative work is inspired by Judy Chicago. In her [Fresno Fans series](https://www.judychicago.com/gallery/early-workminimal/ew-artwork/#23), she explores colour through minimal geometric shapes.
