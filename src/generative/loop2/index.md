Draw 180 circles. Start with very turbulent circles. Draw each circle a little bit larger than the previous one. Slowly decrease the turbulence of the circles when you are near the 90th circle, so the the circles are almost perfect. Continue drawing smooth circles, but draw them using smooth wavy lines.
