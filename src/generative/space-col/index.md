Draw 12 points randomly, but make sure they are equally distributed on the canvas. Using a space colonization algorithm, draw a slightly shaky line from the bottom right corner and reach each point. You can branch from the main stem. When you reach a point, draw a leaf using half of the inner loop of a Trisectrix of Maclaurin curve. The point of the loop should be aligned with the branch that reached the point.
