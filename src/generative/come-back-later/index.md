Using a noise grid of 25 rows and 25 columns, draw 625 rectangles. Give each rectangle a a rotation that follows the noise grid. The color of each rectangle should vary minimally, giveing eahc of them essentially the same color. Given enough time, the color should start to change noticeably. Come back in a year and see if this works.
