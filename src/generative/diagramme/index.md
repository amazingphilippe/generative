Start by drawing four dots in each corner. They don't need to be exactly symmetrical, or form a perfect rectangle. Connect each point to form a shape with four sides. For each side, you will recursively draw either a line, or a rectangle. At each recursion, head towards the center of the canvas. You may choose to reduce the size of your chosen shape at every step, or keep drawing the same sized shape. You may add any degree of rotation to your shape. If you chose to draw lines, you may add dots to the ends of your lines.
