Draw a grid of points from the middle of the canvas, advancing in spirals. For each point that is a prime number, mark the begining of a line. For each point, flip a coin that has a probability matching the prime number theorem. That is the probability for prime numbers less or equal to the current point. If the random number is less than the prime number theorem coin, make the ending of a line. Connect the line beginings and endings with a randomly coloured line.
