Draw between 200 and 800 points. Starting with any point, find the nearest points. Draw a line to the lowest adjacent point. Repeat until it is impossible to continue, then draw a dot at the end of the line. Repeat using any remaining point, until there is no point left.

This piece uses the methodology explained in [Algorithmic landscapes : computational methods for the mediation of form, information, and performance in landscape architecture](https://www.repo.uni-hannover.de/handle/123456789/3768)
