On a fixed grid, Set up a random walk. For each step, make sure the grid cell has not been stepped on. Attempt at least 100 steps per walk. Attempt at least 50 walks. If the grid has no more space or there are no more attempts left, the terrain is fully generated.

For each group of steps (a walk) draw the convex polygon around all steps.

Fill the convex polygons with a zig-zagging line.
