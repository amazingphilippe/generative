When evaluating the lightness of two colours, an efficient technique is to use the persistent vision effect.
Just like joseph albers explains it, to find the darker colour within a selection of two colours, focus longer on the covering corner of the upper paper, and then quickly remove this upper sheet. If the area in the middlenow appears lighter than the lower sheet, then the upper paper is the darker &mdash; and vice versa.
