When staring at the center rectangle, all three colours should now appear as two colours. Per the experiment proposed by Joseph Albers, we can see that we are not achiving the result of the middle colour appearing as two. Generating this effect is probably not possible with a simple program like this one, but we can appreciate the geometry and the blending of the two colours.
