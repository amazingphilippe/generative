Weave a grid of lines. Each line should follow a smooth noise function in the length axis, each parallel line should use the same noise function, but shift it slightly. The ondulating parallel and perpendicular lines will weave like a cloth. To simulate thread changes, keep using the same thread colour for several wefts, before changing to a new colour.
