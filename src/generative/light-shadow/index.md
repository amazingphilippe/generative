On a 5 x 5 grid, draw a series of dots centered on the crossing grid lines. Weave an imaginary line around all dots, so that each dot either pulls or pushes the line into an interesting shape. Color the dots in black or white, to illustrate which points pulls or pushes the line. Color the generated shape with a vibrant colour.
