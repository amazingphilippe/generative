# Generative art for [Cliqu.art](https://www.cliqu.art/)

The source code for my shenanigans. I leave this in the open because it contains a lot of amazing foundational work done by very kind and smart people. This wouldn't be possible without any of it.

What you see here are original generative creations, which are inspired by the things that I love. Most pieces come from hours spent tinkering and iterating outputs. Some other pieces are more delibarate generative adaptions of the work of others, always cited to my best ability.

## Usage

Litteraly click the link above and have fun. Pressing the regenerate button or the space bar will output a new different piece.

The outputs are SVG, which  makes everything very suitable for print. Feel free to use any output in your projects, I only ask that you share your project with me. It would make me very happy.

Lastly, please refrain from printing or selling the outputs as-is, unless it is for your own personal enjoyment. These generative pieces are also unsuitable for NFTs, as they are virtually impossible to reproduce twice, and also technically not your work. Thank you.

## Buying

I'm not selling any of these outputs. Yet. If I do decide to do that in the future, the best is to [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/philippecaron)
